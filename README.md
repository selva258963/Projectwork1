Small description about the project like one below
The integration of a chatbot within a hostel booking system, aimed at streamlining the reservation process for students and improving the overall user experience.

## About
Career Compass AI is an intelligent career recommendation system designed to help students identify suitable career paths based on their interests, skills, and educational background.
This project integrates an AI-driven recommendation engine to simplify the decision-making process, reduce confusion, and assist learners in exploring the most relevant career opportunities.
Career Compass AI is developed to support students who often struggle with choosing the right career path due to limited awareness, lack of expert guidance, or overwhelming information.

Traditional career counseling methods involve lengthy manual assessments and one-on-one sessions with advisors. This project addresses these limitations by offering a simple and interactive AI-powered portal that uses structured datasets and intelligent matching algorithms to provide personalized career suggestions.

Using inputs such as interest areas, skill sets, and education level, the system analyzes compatibility and suggests the best-matching professions along with relevant details. This project thus acts as a virtual career counselor, empowering students to make informed decisions confidently.

## Features
